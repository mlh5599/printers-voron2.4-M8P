PIF resource assigned, chose Fusion Filaments [Carbon Rod Black](https://fusionfilaments.com/1kg-abs15-filament-carbon-rod-black) base color and [Heavy Water Blue](https://fusionfilaments.com/1kg-abs15-filament-heavy-water-blue) for the accent. 

I opted to have the Voron Tap Kit printed in [3DXTech Polycarbonate-CF](https://www.3dxtech.com/products/carbonx-pc-cf-1) for a more rigid carraige.  I also chose to have the hotend mount printed in [Fiberology PA12-CF15](https://fiberlogy.com/en/fiberlogy-filaments/pa12cf_en/) for beter heat management/resistance.

### 1 hr
Formbot kit arrived and inventoried.  All parts were presnet and in good condition with the exception of the X-Axis linear rail (Linear Rail MGN12H 400mm).  The bearing on it is pretty gritty, I will likely need to order a replacement.  The sourcing guid recommends [RobotDigg Rails](https://www.robotdigg.com/product/1314/Black-anodized-linear-rail-7,-9,-12-and-15).  Y and Z rails are identical, a couple are not perfect but I think there are enough good ones for the Y-Carriage, I'm not as concerned about the quality of the Z-Axis Rails.

I'm currently still waiting on PIF parts before I can begin the build.

I skipped ahead to page 24 while waiting on my printed parts and spent about an hour cleaning and lubricating my linear rails.

### 3 hr

3d printed parts arrived.

Begain working on the stealthburner assembly, finsihed the clockwork 2 portion in about 2 hours with very little difficulty.  My Dragon HF hotend is still stuck in customs but I went ahead and put together the tool carriage and fully assembled and wired the stealth burner.
